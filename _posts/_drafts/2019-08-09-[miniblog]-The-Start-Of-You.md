The book by Ried Hoffman gives an interesting prespective to plan your career that resonated with me. He starts by quoting Muhammad Yunus 

### All human beings are entrepreneurs

The book says, just like a caveman who is an entreprenuer by finding food for his family, think of your career as a startup. Think yourself as an work in progress and develop a mindset of ```Permanent Beta```.
While in permanent beta you always are investing in yourself and learning new things. Make a career path where you differentiate yourself from the millions others who can do your job. To have a competative advantage you develop your assets according to market realities which also satisfy your aspirations

*Assets, Aspirations and Market realities are the 3 pieces of puzzle which cannot work without each other*

> Picking a market niche where you're better than the competition is key to entrepreneurial strategy.

### Learn by doing
> Actions, not plans, will generate the lessons that help you adapt to the next phase of your journey.

Your identity is found through experimentation, fill the gaps of incomplete knowledge about yourself and your industry. Prioritize learning and think 2 steps ahead.

### ABZ plan
- Plan A: What you are doing now (your experiment). Your current implementation of you competative advantage. 
- Plan B: You pivot to B when your current plan is not working or you find a better way to achieve your goal
- Plan Z: Your lifeboat plan if something goes seriously wrong.

> An experimental plan A, an alternative plan B and unchanging, certain plan Z
